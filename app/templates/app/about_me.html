        <h2>About Me</h1>

        <p style="font-size:12px">Adam has been interested in health and wellness for as long as he can remember. His path began as he was studying pre-med at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. It was during this time that he realized his passions were pulling him in a different direction. The lack of connection he witnessed in students’ work/life balance caused him to abandon medicine and pursue a new idea. He was determined to carve out a career where he could help others achieve a sense of balance in their lives. He became a certified 200-hour yoga teacher while traveling abroad in Cali, Colombia. He has been teaching ever since. He has furthered his yoga education to include over 500 hours of training. To compliment this physical practice, Adam has been studying meditation since 2012. He has practiced and studied Mindfulness Meditation, Vipassana, and most recently Transcendental Meditation. The simple practices of moving the body and quieting the mind have influenced all aspects of Adam’s life.</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px">Amidst all these studies Adam was dealing with a chronic injury in his shoulder. Although both yoga and meditation helped to ease and relieve the pain, he decided to pursue a more direct approach to healing through massage therapy. After 1 session with a massage therapist Adam had both increased range of motion in his shoulder joint, as well as decreased pain. Adam attended the Bancroft School of Massage Therapy where he learned firsthand how to help manage improve chronic pain conditions. He learned a variety of techniques, including swedish, deep tissue, and sports massage. He has a passion for increasing clients sense of well-being through the healing touch of massage. He hopes to continue his studies with neuromuscular and orthopedic specializations in the very near future.Outside the massage space Adam can be found hiking, rock-climbing, practicing yoga, gardening, reading, or fermenting.</p>
